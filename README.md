The goal of this project is to better predict Monsoon (Austral Summer Precipitation in Southern Africa SA)


convlstmn_precip_nino34
This is the first attempt at building a ConvLSTMN to predict monthly Southern African Precipitation

bootstrapped_mean_test and precip_time_series 
were initial examination of time series of precipitation over time

enso, find_sst, iod, abfz, emi are examination of different sst zones on SA precipitation 

ml_random_forest and regression were statistical looks at correlation between SST and other factors and precipitation
in SA
